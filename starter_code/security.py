Task 6: A basic access-control gate for your sales reports.

This module covers KM-04 KT08: Data Security (the CIA triad —
Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability — and practical protections
like encryption / hashing and access control).

We are NOT building bank-grade security here — the goal is to
DEMONSTRATE that you understand why sensitive reports shouldn't be
open to anyone, and one simple way (password hashing) to protect them.

IMPORTANT SECURITY LESSON (this is the whole point of the task):
    NEVER store a password as plain text. Always store a HASH of the
    password. hashlib.sha256() is used below for learning purposes.

# README why storing it in the database (KM-04 idea) would be better
# than hardcoding it here.

# REFLECTION (answer in your README, not in code):
#
#   1. Confidentiality — how does this login gate support it?
#   2. Integrity — the login gate does NOT protect data integrity.
#      What in your database.py design (Task 3) helps with integrity
#      instead? (Hint: think about primary keys and data types.)
#   3. Availability — what is one risk to availability for a project
#      like this stored only on your own laptop, and what would you
#      recommend to protect against it?
